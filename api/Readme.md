# Interfaces

*  [api.md](api.md) is an example how an API definition for the backend may look like

## Lexware aka Lexoffice API
* `lexoffice_contact.json` is a request example to generate a new contact in Lexoffice.
* `lexoffice_invoice_for_contact.json` is a request to create an example invoice for an existing contact in Lexoffice.
* `lexoffice_invoice_single-shot.json` creates an invoice without generating a contact. This is not the standard way of doing things, but a good starting point for a MVP.
