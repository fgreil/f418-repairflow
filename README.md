# f418-repairflow
Towards a simple but efficient workflow for mobile phone repair shops.

My example why building new custom new software is nowadays probably more efficient than buying a huge software suite(s) and painfully customizing them (and their interconnections).

## Howto
For now, there is no MVP (=minimal viable product) yet. What's available already:

1. Take a look at the sample one-page-site [repair-wizard.html](repair-wizard.html). Just download the file and open it in your favorite browser.
2. The file [flow.mmd](flow.mmd) is a **Mermaid diagram**. It is a basically text-based diagramming (top-left switch: `code`) using a simple, human-readable syntax. Github auto-magically plots the flowchart (top-left switch `Preview`).
3. The same flow is also available as [flow.bpmn](flow.bpmn). BPMN stands for **Business Process Model and Notation** &nbsp; the abundant, industry-recognized syntax. You will need viewers like the [Camunda modeler](https://camunda.com/de/download/modeler/) to view the diagram.
4. The folder `data` contains a (AI-generated and not verified) list of smartphone models and their respective repair types.
